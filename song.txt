If I were you, I'd treat them better
If I were you, I'd settle the weather
It's coming soon, I'd pull it together
Yeah, get it together, it's a matter of time
If I were you
Oh, tell me how it feels, conspiracy cadet
Wound up like a cassette, the tape about to shed
If chaos is a ladder, hell is heaven sent
Keep pulling at the thread while cashing in the cheque
No telling what I'd do
With my hands stuck on you
No telling what I'd do
With my hands
If I were you, I'd treat them better
If I were you, I'd settle the weather
It's coming soon, I'd pull it together
Yeah, get it together, it's a matter of time
If I were you, I'd treat them better
If I were you, I'd settle the weather
You'll get what's due, I'd square the vendetta
Yeah, get it together, it's a matter of time
Think you're pretty wily, blowing up the sun?
Confuse a loaded question with a smoking gun
You move like Dunning-Kruger, truth is overdone
A father like his son, look after number one, yeah
No telling what I'd do
With my hands stuck on you
No telling what I'd do
With my hands
